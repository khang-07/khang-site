in document1, coal mining in britain 
and coal miners dramatically increases 
between 1800â€“1880
the historical context of document 1
is the enclosure acts, which forced
peasant yeoman farmers off their lands
and into cities, where they worked in 
coal mines
this is significant because britain utilized
coal to manufacture others goods in order
to monopolize textile production globally

this would result in increase employment,
lower cost of production and britain
dominating world economy,
imperialism (scramble for africa)

in document2, british pig iron production
skyrocketed between 1830-70.
the historical context of doc2 is the 
bessemer process 1853 which allowed
pig iron to be efficiently
transformed into steel, a very durable
and useful material to construct
guns and buildings.
this would result in increase
imperialism (scramble for africa)
